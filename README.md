# Design Handoff Project

This wee we transformed a UX student's design into a React-based landing page for a gym/fitness club. This project bridges the gap between design and development, showcasing the art of bringing visuals to life with code.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem: This week was a fanastic experience and a good challenge. I really enjoyed the real-life aspect of taking a design and following specs to create it. Unfortunetly, my designer had some heath and scheduling issues that meant I have been coding with an incomplete design and was only give then hand-off on Wednesday morning. My designer did not attend our demos on Friday.

As of Saturday, I have a complete homepage of desktop and tablet design to work from. I have no mobile design and no form/about me page. Therefore, my requirements as a coder cannot be met and I have informed Technigo of the situation. When my designer is complete I will continue to work on the project.

I had some styling issues this week: 
1) There is a background image that covers both hero section and navbar section, I think I need to move my navbar component into the hero section?
2) In the "meet the founders" section the 3 images on the right also bleed out the top and bottom of the section. I haven't solved this yet. The bottom of the section is also not a horizontal line, with a small upward slant, I have been researching ideas to acheive this.
3) The footer has also give me issues, trying to use grid box to aline the items as specified
4) At this stage all language functionality is in the program and it is tested with a button at the bottom, I need to link this button to the rest of the components and fill out the .json files. I have started with the "About Us" section and once the button is working I will do the rest.

What tools and techniques you used to solve it: I used React Router (Route, Routes, Link, NavLink) and ????? to handle language translation.

What technologies did you use?: HTML5, CSS3, React, React Router, with Editor: VS Code

If you had more time, what would be next?: I would have loved more time with the designer and a more complete design, but value the experience as this will no doubt happen in the real world. The designer made some difficult design choices that I found very hard to acheive as the developer.
